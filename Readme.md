# Elden Ring Item Tracker

## What Does It Do?

The Elden Ring tracker was created to help players collect and track in-game items and abilities. By accumilating all the items within the game and putting them into a database, this app simplifies the process of searching for and locating desired objects.

The application is able to overlay the top of the fullscreen Elden Ring window and allows for seemless integration when searching for items.

## How Does It Work?

With use of the [Fextralife](https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Elden+Ring+Wiki) Elden Ring Wikipedia, a database has been created listing every item and spell within the game, inlcuding the locations of where to find them and more.

Upon showing the application window you are able to search for any item, either using the search bar or by accessing the many categories under the weapons, armor, spell menus.

# Future Development Ideas

### **Character Build Screen**

A character build screen would allow the user to select their desired equipment and plan future builds showing important information such as weapon and armor stats.

### **Total Items Completion Tracker**

For the completionists out there, being able to see what has or hasnt been collected would be an interesting source of information to include, giving feedback such as total percent of items collected.

### **Independant Item Pages**

When looking for more information about the specified object, you would be able to access item specific pages detailing stats and bonuses.
